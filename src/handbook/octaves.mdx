# Guitar octave

This applies to western music, not just the guitar.

The interval between one musical pitch.

Musical notes are A, A#/Bβ, B, C, C#/Dβ, D, D#/Eβ, E, F, F#Gβ, G, G#/Aβ

Lets drop the flat (β) for a second. One octave is:
A, A-sharp, B, C, C-sharp, D, D-sharp, E, F, F-sharp, G, G-sharp. The next note after G-sharp is an A again, but a pitch higher. The musical notes cycles to a pitch higher, aka an octave.

Makes sure your guitar is tunned. The easiest exercise to hear a pitch or octave higher note is to play the two outer strings.
They sound the same if tuned to standard tunning. E on the top string, sounds similar to the E on the bottom string. The theory is that 
it vibrates at double the frequency.

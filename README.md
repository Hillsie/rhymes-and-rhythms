# Learn Music

Welcome to the Learn Music Repo, a laid-back hub for things musical! It's a mishmash of practical music exercises, notes, games, and a sprinkle of theory.

The whole idea behind this repository is to make music learning fun and accessible. For the creator, music revolves around the sweet sound of a guitar, while their son keeps the rhythm on the drums. But don't let that limit you! Feel free to add your own section to share your musical passions.

The creator has been toying with the guitar for years but, like many of us, hasn't always found the time to practice. This repository is a humble attempt to blend continued learning with a practical approach.

## What's Inside so far?

### Fretboard
This section is all about learning the musical notes along the guitar fretboard. Not entirely sure where this journey will lead, bu at this stage it has a fretboard exercise ... in progress.

### Handbook
The handbook is like a quick cheat sheet on various topics. When things start to get a bit twisty and complicated with deep music theory, there's links to some sources to explore.
